# boring-text-to-hypertext
Convert simple text files to HTML files however you want using a schema file. It's just a simple tool that anybody could make, yes, but it's robust and flexible to style it or script it in just about any way that you want.

It could have heavier and customizable text processing but if you're marking up text files to make into HTML files you might as well be making HTML files in the first place. The only case I can think of where you might want this is where you have text files that were originally targetted to a different display system, but, again, that's not what this is. Though, if I come back to this, I'll make it happen.
